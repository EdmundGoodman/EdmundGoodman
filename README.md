Extra-curricular projects I have completed are stored in repositories on this git account:

1. Large, completed projects with a significant software component
    * [Rouse research](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/rouse-research), a project addressing the question: "How effective are machine learning algorithms compared with traditional analytical techniques, with respect to playing abstract games?"
    * [EES](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/EES), the code repository for an automated tennis ball collector entered into the engineering education scheme

2. A-level coursework, as private repositories to conform to exam board regulations, available to view on request
    * [Computer science coursework](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/NEA-Project)
    * [Physics coursework](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/physics-coursework)

3. Smaller projects designed to play games optimally
    * [Hangman winner](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/hangman-solver), a project designed to play Hangman as well as possible
    * [Boggle winner](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/boggle-game), a project designed to play Boggle as well as possible
    * [Probe winner](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/probeWinner), a project designed to play Probe as well as possible

4. Simulators of various formal and real-life systems
    * [Conway's game of life](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/conways-game-of-life), a project simulating the cellular automata Conway's game of life
    * [Langton's ant](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/langtons-ant), a project simulating the cellular automata Langton's ant
    * [Physics simulator](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/physics-simulator), a project simulating the movement of particles due to electrostatic or gravitational forces
    * [Towers of Hanoi winner](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/towers-of-hanoi), a project designed to complete the Towers of Hanoi problem optimally

5. Miscellaneous projects
    * [Markov chains](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/markov-chains), a project employing stochastic processes to natural language processing \- randomly generating human-readable text from a corpus data set
    * [Monty hall](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/monty-hall), a project simulating the Monty hall problem, showing that changing the selection is the better course of action
    * [Partition numbers](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/partition-numbers), a project to generate the nth partition number
