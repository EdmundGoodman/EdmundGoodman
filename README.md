Live web server hosted [here](http://www-rinchi.ch.cam.ac.uk/qrinchi/). A sister project is [InChI markush](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/InChiMarkush), a website which deconstructs MarkInChI codes

   - [Hangman](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/hangman-solver), a program that uses statistical analysis of a dictionary to play the game hangman optimally
   - [Probe](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/probeWinner), a program that uses  statistical analysis of a dictionary to play the game probe optimally
   - [Markov chains](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/markov-chains), employing stochastic processes to natural language processing \- randomly generating human-readable text from a corpus data set
   - [Card model](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/cardModel), an object model of a pack of cards to facilitate writing programs to play card games

   


2. Ongoing projects
