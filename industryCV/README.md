# Original README text of template

This is just a template, I encourage you to modify it if you don't like how something looks. For example, you can change the fonts to something you like better. Or, add bullet points to the project section.

# My notes

This template is under the Apache license, and I am using it under fair use - changing the content but not the theme.

I also modified the template slightly to use Tikz rather than fontawesome to keep dependencies minimal.
